### Pan & Zoom 
We now support Pan and Zoom for the diagram preview, where the user pan to a specific part of a large diagram, and also set different levels of zoom based on his preference. We implemented the zoom with stickiness, so that zoom levels are not changed when you edit your diagram
Users can of course use the reset option to resize the preview diagram to fit the screen.
![Pan & Zoom](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/img/plugins/vscode-plugin-pan.png)

### Export Diagrams
Export your diagrams easily in both SVG and PNG formats. This makes it simple to:
